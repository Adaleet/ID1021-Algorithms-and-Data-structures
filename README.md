# ID1021 HT23 Algorithms and Data Structures 

## Welcome!
This repository is currently a work in progress. In the meantime, feel free to explore the completed assignments from the previous year. These assignments cover fundamental concepts in:
- **Data Structures**: Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Hashing, and Graphs.
- **Algorithm Design Paradigms**: Recursion, Divide-and-Conquer, Greedy Algorithms, Dynamic Programming.
- **Sorting and Searching Algorithms**: Binary Search, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.
- **Graph Algorithms**: BFS, DFS, Shortest Paths, and Minimum Spanning Trees.
- **Complexity Analysis**: Time and space complexity, Big-O notation.
